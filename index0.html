Who We Are


</h2>
 <p>


  Welcome to the Grace Gospel Hall website. We are a company of Christians from many
  backgrounds and many walks of life with one essential theme in common...we have all come to know
  God&#39;s Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, as our own personal Saviour and Lord. We know for certain, on the
  basis of God&#39;s Word (the Holy Bible), that our sins are forgiven, that we will be in heaven at the end of
  life&#39;s journey and we know the Lord Jesus now as our companion and friend along the way. What did
  we do to deserve all this?! Absolutely nothing!!! We are living in the personal, joyful confidence that <strong>
  &quot;the Son of God loved me, and gave Himself for me&quot;</strong> We believe that God has good news in Jesus
  Christ for fallen man. Jesus said in Luke 19:10 <strong>&quot;For The son of Man has come to seek and to
  save that which was lost.&quot;</strong>
<br><br>
  Our meetings are conducted in an orderly fashion with reverence to God. We seek to provide a warm
  and friendly atmosphere in which you can find peace with God through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,
  Our small and friendly fellowship has no denominational affiliation but is self-governed and self-
  supported.<br>
  No public collections or appeals for funds are ever made. In addition, we are active in Sunday school
  and evangelism outreaches. Come and learn why He and He alone, is the source of eternal life, the
  way to heaven, and the real resource for meaning in life. Come and hear about the Jesus of the Bible.
  We have public speaking style gospel meetings, conversational-style Bible studies, class-style
  Sunday school...something for all ages. Give God the opportunity to enrich your life as you learn from
  His Word and discover His purpose for your life.
<br><br>
  The building is called a &quot;Gospel Hall&quot; because it is a place where the plain and simple Gospel is
  preached according to Marc 16:15. Believing that the Bible is verbally inspired by God, Himself, and is
  worthy of being our only creed, as well as infallible guide. We have a deep commitment to Biblical
  Christianity. We invite you to come to our Sunday school and bring your children. There are classes
  for all ages, where happy, dedicated teachers give Bible lessons suitable to each age group(every
  Sunday 11h15 AM).<br>
  We warmly invite you to attend our gospel service on every first Sunday evening of the month at
  7:00 PM to hear how you, through faith in Jesus Christ, may have eternal life and know for certain
  that you are going to heaven.

What We Believe


</h2>
<h3>
<strong>“Things which are most surely believed among us.”</strong>
 <small>(Luke 1:1)</small>

</h3>




<h4>The Scriptures of Truth</h4><p>
We believe the Bible is in the truest sense the very word of God, given by inspiration of God (2 Peter
1:21; 2 Tim. 3:16) inerrant, authoritative, and all sufficient (Psa. 119:89,160; 2 Tim. 3:17), being the
supreme and final word in all matters of faith and Christian behavior. (Deut. 6:6; Josh. 1:81; Psa.
19:7-11; Psa. 119:9, 30, 98, 99, 105; Jer. 23:28-29; Rom. 15:4).

</p><h4>The God-Head</h4><p>
We believe in one God (Deut. 4:35-39; Isa. 45:5-21; 1 Cor. 8:4-6) eternally existing in three persons -
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-6) - the same in
substance, equal in power and glory.

</p><h4>Christ’s Perfect Manhood</h4><p>
We believe in the whole incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ (John 1:14), whoever was the &quot;only
begotten ” Son of God, the eternal “Word” that was with God, and was God (John 1:1; Mic. 5:2) but
who, that He might do the will of his Father, condescended to become man (Phil. 2:5-9), being
sinlessly begotten of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary (Luke 1:35), and of her brought
into the world (Luke 2:11; Gal. 4:4-5); very God yet truly man (1 Tim. 3:1 6; 1 John 5:20).

</p><h4>The Holy Spirit</h4><p>
We believe in the Personality of the Holy Spirit of God - the third person in the Trinity (Matt. 28:19; 1
Cor. 2:9-11; 1 Cor. 12:11); and that it is He who quickens into life (John 6:63); and regenerates the
sinner (John 3:5); making him a child of God through faith in Christ Jesus (Gal. 3:26); producing in
him the fruits of righteousness, as manifested in a changed manner of life,-- “old things passed
away&quot;, “all things become new ” 2 Cor. 5:17).

</p><h4>Creation and Fall of Man</h4><p>
We believe that man was created by God in His own image and likeness, a perfect specimen of
manhood, and not &quot;evolved &quot;from some lower forms of life (Gen. 1:26-27). Through disobedience to
the command of God, he fell from his high estate, and became a sinner in nature and by practice
(Gen. 2:1 7; 3:1 -7; Rom. 5:12). Because of this, also, he became alienated from God and &quot;dead in
trespasses and in sins” (Rom. 3:9-19; Col. 1:21; Eph. 2:1-3).

</p><h4>The Death of Christ </h4><p>
We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died as a substitutionary Sacrifice for our sins (Rom. 5:6-8; 1
Cor. 15:3-4; 1 Peter 3:18); satisfying the demands of God’s holy Law against us as sinners, and
putting away sin by the sacrifice of Himself (Heb. 9:24-26; 10:4- 14), He made it possible for God to be
just and yet be the Justifier of all who believe in the Lord Jesus as their own personal Savior (Rom. 3:24-26).
Therefore, because of the value that God &#39;s Word attaches to the finished work of Christ on
Calvary &#39;s Cross, the sinner who believes is now eternally saved from the penalty of his sin (John
19:30; Acts 13:39-41; Heb. 5:9), not on the ground of his prayers and works, but alone through
the blood of Christ (Eph. 2:8-9). Good works are the fruit of salvation, -- the “things that accompany” it
(Heb. 6:9); God’s purpose being that His people should be “Zealous of good works&quot;, and “careful to
maintain&quot; them (Titus 2:14; 3:8).

</p><h4>The Resurrection and Enthronement of Christ</h4><p>
We believe in the resurrection of the crucified body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Of this He gave
indisputable evidence, appearing unto many, and companying with them for a period of forty days
after the resurrection (Luke 24:1-32; John 20:19-29; 1 Cor. 15: 3-9; Acts 1:3). Then He, in the
presence of credible witnesses, ascended up to Heaven (Acts 1:7), where He is now enthroned at the
Father&#39;s right hand and engaged for us as our Advocate and Great High Priest; ever living in the
presence of God to make intercession for us (Heb. 1:1-3; 1 John 2:1-2; Heb. 4:14-16; Rom. 8:34;
Heb. 7:25).

</p><h4>The Local Church or Assembly</h4><p>
We believe in the truth of the local church or assembly as God &#39;s testimony on earth during this age;
that it is a local company of believers gathered unto the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, baptized by
immersion and believing and practicing the apostles doctrine, that is, all the New Testament
teachings. (Acts 2:41-42). 
The purity of the assembly must be maintained and when moral or doctrinal evil is committed or
practiced the guilty person must be put away (excommunicated), in order that the glory of God may
be maintained and the erring one put outside the local church where the restoring grace of God
can reach him. (1 Cor. 5:13; 2 Cor. 2:3-8)
Reception of a Christian into the fellowship and exercise of the privileges and responsibilities of the
local Church is by either of two ways: (1) after personal interview with the elders to determine the
moral, spiritual and doctrinal fitness of the individual and announcement of the individual’s name to
the whole assembly, or, (2) by verbal or written commendation giving assurance that an individual
already is in the fellowship of another scripturally gathered assembly of Christians.
Fellowship between local assemblies is based on conformity to the Word of God in faith and practice
alone and not upon any man-made association or circle of fellowship.
Separation from the world in its associations and ways is enjoined upon the saints (2 Cor. 6:14-18; I
John 2:15-17).
The headship of Christ is acknowledged in the church gatherings by the uncovered heads of the men,
by the long hair, covered heads and silent participation of the women, and by a reverent attitude of all
(1 Cor. 11:1-16; 14:34-35, 40).
Gatherings of the local church are for the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, prayer, the ministry and
study of the Word of God, the preaching of the gospel and for Sunday school activities.

</p><h4>The Priesthood of All Believers</h4><p>
We believe that all true Christians are constituted by God a “holy priesthood ” and as such are
privileged to approach Him in worship (1 Peter 2:5; Heb. 10:19-22), which as God is a Spirit, must be
in spirit and truth (John 4:24; Phil. 3:3). They are also made of God a “royal priesthood”, that they
may serve Him, in showing forth the true virtues of the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:9). In their
privileges of worship, all stand alike before God there being no such distinctions as “clergy” or &quot;laity&quot;
known to the New Testament Scriptures, nor is there any Scriptural authority for the use of a divine
title, such as “Reverend” by any man (Psa. 111:9; Matt. 23:8). We find in Scripture that while as
to worship all are equal, yet in the service of the Lord and in the ministry of the Word each one has
his own place and sphere. Women, for instance, who have an honorable sphere of service that no
man can fill, are yet forbidden to take a public place in the preaching and teaching of the Word (I Cor.
14:34-36; l Tim. 2:11-12; Titus 2:3-5).

</p><h4>Baptism and the Lord’s Supper</h4><p>
We believe the Lord Jesus left for the obedience of His people two ordinances, memorial in character,
which are to continue through the Church Age (Rom. 6:3-5; 1 Cor. 11:26); Baptism and the Lord’s
Supper. Baptism is by immersion in water, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
(Matt. 28:19-20), showing our union with Christ in death and resurrection (Col. 2:11-12). The Lord’s
Supper, when we partake together of the bread and wine, is symbolic of His body and His shed
blood. We do this during his absence in remembrance of the Lord who died for us, looking forward,
according to His promise, to His return. As often as we eat this bread and drink this cup, we do show
the Lord&#39;s death till he come. This memorial feast is to be held weekly, -- on the first day of each week
(Acts 20:7); -- and is for believers in the local assembly fellowship only.

</p><h4>Satan, His Person, Work and Destiny</h4><p>
We believe in the personality of Satan, as a real, active and malicious being, -- the arch enemy of God
and man (Job 1:6; 1 Chron. 21:1; Zach. 3:1 ), who, having fallen from his state in which God created
him (Isa. 14:12-19; Ezek. 28:11-19; 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6), encompassed the ruin of our first parents
(Gen. 3) and is now engaged in seeking to defeat God &#39;s purposes in the world and among His saints
by all manner of subtle and diabolical devices (Matt. 13:19-25; 1 Peter 5:8). His judgment is that he
shall be thrust into the bottomless abyss during the Millennial Age, and later to be cast into the Lake
of Fire, forever (Rev. 20:1-10).

</p><h4>Conscious Existence After Death</h4><p>
We believe in the conscious and eternal punishment after death of the impenitent wicked (Psa. 9:17;
Matt. 25:41; Mark 9:43-49; Luke 16:19-31). As the spirits of the righteous at death go to be with Christ
in Heaven, they being “absent from the body and present with the Lord (Phil. 1:23; 2 Cor. 5:1-8; Acts
8:2), their bodies are left behind until Christ &#39;s second coming, when they will be raised from the dead
incorruptible, reunited with their spirits, and so be &quot;forever with the Lord” (1 Cor. 15:51-57; 1 Thess.
4:14). In like manner, the spirits of those who die out of Christ, descent into Hell (Luke 16:22-23)
their bodies being raised and reunited with their spirits, at the Great White Throne Judgement (Rev.
20:11-13), their eternal destiny from there being the Lake of Fire (Rev. 20:15; Rev. 21:8). In either
case, the departed spirit, in the interval between death and resurrection, is not &quot;asleep&quot; -- the body
alone being so spoken of (John 11:11) - - but fully conscious whether in bliss or woe. This solemn
truth we consider of very grave importance affecting the foundations of the Faith and in view of the
widespread effort of Satan to deny it we take our stand upon the Word of God in which we have the
plain statements of the Lord Jesus and believe anyone holding or teaching non eternity of punishment
should be denied a place in the fellowship of God&#39;s people (2 John 9:11)
